# HaxeUIExamples
 Examples for HaxeUI.

Minimal examples to help make learning to use HaxeUI easier.

I personally prefer straight to the point simple examples of how to do certain things vs examples with extra un-needed frills.

I feel that it makes retaining what is learned easier. I know there are many others that feel the same way and will benefit from me sharing these examples.

I hope you find them useful.




Huge Thank You! to Ian for creating HaxeUI and for helping me learn via the examples he has been so kind to provide and explain to me as needed. 

Sometimes I have a tendency to overthink thus leading me to over complicate whatever problem I am trying to solve.  This in turn causes me to sometimes not be able to see some of the most simple solutions to a problem. Thats when I turn to Ian and he saves the day...   along with my sanity. :)

He is not only a very talented creator, he is also a wonderful guide with much knowledge and insight to be shared.
